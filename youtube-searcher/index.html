    <h1>Youtube Video Searcher</h1>
    <h2>Bulk search for youtube videos and get a list of links.</h2>
    <p>It is likely that this site will lose its permission to access the YouTube API.
      I'll leave this available for now, but expect it to disappear if the API key expires.</p>
    <p>This searcher can be used to query a bunch of youtube videos
      based on a query that are <strong>under 10 minutes in length</strong>.
      Enter your query in the first box, and optionally include a range of dates
      to search between then click submit. After a short period, a list of links
      will appear in the text field below.</p>
    <h3>Tips and tricks</h3>
    <p>Your request can also use the Boolean NOT (-) and OR (|) operators to
      exclude videos or to find videos that are associated with one of several
      search terms. For example, to search for videos matching either "boating"
      or "sailing", set the search term to boating|sailing. Similarly,
      to search for videos matching either "boating" or "sailing" but not
      "fishing", set the search term to boating|sailing -fishing.</p>
    <p> For best results, format your before and after times as
      RFC 3339 formatted date-time value (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z)
      There are many tools available to explain this.
      <strong>However, most common date formats will work,
        just less reliably</strong>
    <h3>Youtube Enforced Quotas</h3>
    <p>Unfortunately, Youtube enforces quotas on their API calls.
      You should never hit their quota, but if you see the quota
      mentioned in error messages, that is what it refers to. It
      is a daily quota and will reset over time. </p>
