      I work as a software engineer writing C++ code at Microsoft on Outlook, among other things.

    <h2>Projects and things</h2>
    <p>
      Some of the things I'm working on, or have worked on before. In general, you can find some of my work over on <a
        href="https://github.com/vidia">my Github</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Pebble</h3>
    <p>I can't guarantee these work anymore, but I miss Pebble so you can find two of my old Pebble watchfaces here: <a
        href="./unix-time.pbw">Time CLI</a> and <a href="./xtern-pebble.pbw">Xtern Logo</a>.</p>

      <h2>Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        This is far from comprehensive, but here are some resources that have been valuable to me.
        First, here are some links that I like to use to find useful tools and privacy-respecting servies.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://privacytoolsio.github.io/privacytools.io/">PrivacyTools.io</a>: A great primer on privacy
          with some utilities you can use.</li>
        <li><a href="https://thatoneprivacysite.net/">That One Privacy Site</a>: Home of a great VPN comparison and
          other privacy info. I shouldn't recommend any specific VPN for everyone, so this site is the best place to
          start your own research.</li>
        <li><a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">Have I Been Pwned?</a>: Learn if your email was included in any data
          leaks so you can know which passwords need to be updated immediately.</li>
        <li><a href="https://ssd.eff.org/en">EFF Surveiance Self Defense</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://twit.tv/shows/security-now">Podcast: Security Now</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you are looking for immediate answers, I currently use and can recommend these browser extensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation">uBlock Origin</a>: A wide spectrum ad blocker</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere">HTTPS Everywhere</a>: Make sure you are using HTTPS whenever
          it is available.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.eff.org/privacybadger">Privacy Badger</a>: Block online trackers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Beyond browser extensions, get a password manager. I won't recommend any specific one, but password managers
        will help you make and keep track of unique, random passwords for every site you use.</p>

    <p>I don't have anywhere else link to these, so I'll drop them here</p>
